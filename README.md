There is a theory that Hamas fires rockets only on round hours, so I downloaded all the alarms that were in the last month and made a histogram to check if this is true. It turns out that this is really, really true, but sometimes they shoot on the half-round hour

I also made a histogram of the distribution throughout the day if anyone is interested (you can really see the spikes of the round and semi-round hours)
